# Automatic git mirror

This container provides the functionality of automatically mirroring between
pairs of git instances. It will pull in intervals from the mirror source and
check for updates, and if there are any push them to the mirror target.

# How to use

Copy the [docker-compose.yml.example](example docker-compose.yml file) to
the "docker-compose.yml" filename, and then edit it with the required mirror
info.
